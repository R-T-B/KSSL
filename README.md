# Install
To install, simply extract a release zip into your [KSP Install folder]/PDLauncher.  KSP2 release zips are for KSP2 only.  The others are for KSP1.

This is a .net core 3.1 app and will prompt you to install that if not present.  May work crossplatform if you can install it too, no idea, I only tested on windows.
